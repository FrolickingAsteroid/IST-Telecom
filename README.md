# Telecomunicações 2022/2023

This repository contains the lab materials for the **Telecomunicações** course at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. The documents are organized into the following folders:

- `Lab1`: Generation of Digital Signals
- `Lab2`: Demodulation of a MONO FM signal
- `Lab3`: Demodulation of a STEREO FM signal
- `Lab4`: QPSK Demodulation with Symbol Sync

The labs cover a wide range of topics, including digital signal generation, FM signal demodulation, and QPSK demodulation with symbol synchronization. The programs were implemented using GNU Radio Companion, which transpiles the .grc schematic into a .py source file.

For **Lab4**, Python scripts were developed to acquire and process relevant data, as well as to create insightful plots for analysis.

Only **Lab3** and **Lab4** provide LaTeX reports, explaining the theory, simulation methodology, and results, while Lab1 and Lab2 serve as tutorials to facilitate the software utilization.
